The NEWS file for the GlassCoder package.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.1 -- 25 June 2022

Changes:
   HLS Streaming. Major rework of the HLS encoder to increase
   multi-threading and hence performance on multi-core processors.
   Removed support for generating multi-rate streams via HLS.
   Added a '--server-no-deletes' switch to glasscoder(1) to suppress
   DELETE transactions (useful when publishing to services such as
   Akamai MSL-4 which do not require client-generated publish-point
   cleanup).

   Credentials Handling. Added '--credentials-file' and '--delete-credentials'
   switches to glasscoder(1) while deprecating use of the '--server-auth'
   switch. Also added to glasscoder(1) is the ability to use an ssh(1)
   identity file (private key) for authentication when publishing HLS streams.
   See the glasscoder(1) man page for details.

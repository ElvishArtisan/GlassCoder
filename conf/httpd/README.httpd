                   README for Apache HLS Configuration

The files in this directory are for a basic HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)
setup on Apache.  They should be installed as follows:

Apache configuration directory:

       hls.conf
       hls.passwd

The 'hls.passwd' file will need at least one password entry added to it
to allow GlassCoder's HLS streaming connector to upload files.  See the
htpasswd(1) man page for details.

Apache cgi-bin directory:

       hls_methods.pl

This is the installation file for the GlassCoder package.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building GlassCoder:

Qt4 Toolkit, v4.6 or better (http://www.trolltech.com/).

Secret Rabbit Code
A sample-rate converter library, written by Erik de Castro Lopo.  Included
with most distros, or you can find it at http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/.


OPTIONAL PREREQUISITES -- At least one of the following is required:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AACPlus - HE-AAC+ Codec, v2.0.2 or later.  Needed for generating MPEG-4
HE-AAC+ streams.  Available at http://tipok.org.ua/node/17.  Be sure to
read the important legal notice at the bottom of that page!

FAAC - Free Advanced Audio Codec, v1.28 or later.  Needed for generating
MPEG-2 AAC streams.  Available at http://www.audiocoding.com/faac.html.

LAME - MPEG-1 Layer 3 Encoder Library, v.99.3 or later.  Needed for
generating MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3) streams.  Available at

BUILD ENVIRONMENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some distros may require that the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
environmental variables be set prior to running 'configure' in order for
Qt4 to be detected properly.  Some known cases are:

  CentOS/RedHat 5 (i386): export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib/qt4/include
                	  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/qt4/lib
                	  export PATH=/usr/lib/qt4/bin:$PATH

CentOS/RedHat 5 (x86_64): export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib64/qt4/include
                 	  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64
                	  export PATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/bin:$PATH


INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.

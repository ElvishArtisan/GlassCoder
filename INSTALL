This is the installation file for the GlassCoder package.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building GlassCoder:

Qt4 Toolkit, v4.6 or better (http://www.qt.io/).

Secret Rabbit Code
A sample-rate converter library, written by Erik de Castro Lopo.  Included
with most distros, or you can find it at http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/.


OPTIONAL PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GlassCoder depends upon various third-party libraries to provide support
for both encoding formats ('codecs') and audio sources.  You will need at
least one of each in order to build a functioning binary.

CODECS
------
AACPlus - HE-AAC+ Codec, v2.0.2 or later.  Needed for generating MPEG-4
HE-AAC+ streams.  Available at http://tipok.org.ua/node/17.  Be sure to
read the important legal notice at the bottom of that page!

FAAC - Free Advanced Audio Codec, v1.28 or later.  Needed for generating
MPEG-2 AAC streams.  Available at http://www.audiocoding.com/faac.html.

LAME - MPEG-1 Layer 3 Encoder Library, v3.99.3 or later.  Needed for
generating MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3) streams.  Available at
http://lame.sourceforge.net/.

OggVorbis -  A free, patent-clear audio codec.  Both 'libogg' and 'libvorbis'
libraries are required.  Available at http://www.xiph.org.

TwoLAME - MPEG-1 Layer 2 Encoder Library, v0.2.12 or later.  Needed for
generating MPEG-1 Layer 2 (MP2) streams.  Available at
http://www.twolame.org/.

AUDIO SOURCES
-------------
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), v1.0 or later.  Included in
virtually all Linux distros.  Further information is available at
http://www.alsa-project.org/.

AudioScience HPI (ASIHPI), v4.00 or later.  Advanced audio API for using
the line of professional, high-end audio cards from AudioScience Corporation.
Available at http://www.audioscience.com/.

LibSndFile (FILE), v1.0.7 or later.  Library for reading audio files.
Available at http://mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/.

JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK).  System for interconnecting audio devices
and applications.  Available at http://jackaudio.org/.


BUILD ENVIRONMENT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some distros may require that the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
environmental variables be set prior to running 'configure' in order for
Qt4 to be detected properly.  Some known cases are:

  CentOS/RedHat 5 (i386): export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib/qt4/include
                	  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/qt4/lib
                	  export PATH=/usr/lib/qt4/bin:$PATH

CentOS/RedHat 5 (x86_64): export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib64/qt4/include
                 	  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64
                	  export PATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/bin:$PATH

Ubuntu:                   export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/qt4

INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.

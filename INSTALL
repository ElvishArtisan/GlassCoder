This is the installation file for the Sirion package.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building Sirion:

Qt4 Toolkit, v4.6 or better (http://www.trolltech.com/).

X11 Window System
Virtually all Linux distros should include this.


BUILD ENVIRONMENT
Some distros may require that the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
environmental variables be set prior to running 'configure' in order for
Qt4 to be detected properly.  Some known cases are:

  CentOS/RedHat 5 (i386): export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib/qt4/include
                	  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/qt4/lib
                	  export PATH=/usr/lib/qt4/bin:$PATH

CentOS/RedHat 5 (x86_64): export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/lib64/qt4/include
                 	  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/qt4/lib64
                	  export PATH=/usr/lib64/qt4/bin:$PATH


INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.

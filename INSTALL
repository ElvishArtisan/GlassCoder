This is the installation file for the GlassCoder package.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building GlassCoder:

Qt5 Toolkit, v5.9 or better (http://www.qt.io/).

Secret Rabbit Code
A sample-rate converter library, written by Erik de Castro Lopo.  Included
with most distros, or you can find it at http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/.

OpenSSL Library, a robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for
the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols.
Available at: https://www.openssl.org/.

TagLib Audio Meta-Data Library, v1.8.0 or better (https://taglib.org/)
A library for reading and writing the meta-data of several popular audio
formats. 


OPTIONAL PREREQUISITES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GlassCoder depends upon various third-party libraries to provide support
for both encoding formats ('codecs') and some audio sources.  You will need
at least one of each in order to build a functioning binary.

CODECS
------
FDK-AAC - Fraunhofer FDK AAC codec for Android.  A codec for generating
MPEG-4 HE-AAC+ streams.  Available at https://github.com/mstorsjo/fdk-aac.

LAME - MPEG-1 Layer III Encoder Library, v3.99.3 or later.  Needed for
generating MPEG-1 Layer III ("MP3") streams.  Available at
http://lame.sourceforge.net/.

OggOpus -  A free, patent-clear audio codec, formally defined in RFC-6716.
Both 'libogg' and 'libopus' libraries are required.  Available at
http://www.xiph.org.

OggVorbis -  A free, patent-clear audio codec.  Both 'libogg' and 'libvorbis'
libraries are required.  Available at http://www.xiph.org.

TwoLAME - MPEG-1 Layer II Encoder Library, v0.2.12 or later.  Needed for
generating MPEG-1 Layer II ("MP2") streams.  Available at
http://www.twolame.org/.

AUDIO SOURCES
-------------
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), v1.0 or later.  Included in
virtually all Linux distros.  Further information is available at
http://www.alsa-project.org/.

AudioScience HPI (ASIHPI), v4.00 or later.  Advanced audio API for using
the line of professional, high-end audio cards from AudioScience Corporation.
Available at http://www.audioscience.com/.

LibSndFile (FILE), v1.0.20 or later.  Library for reading audio files.
Available at http://mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/.

JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK).  System for interconnecting audio devices
and applications.  Available at http://jackaudio.org/.

PLUG-INS
--------
GlassCoder include a PyPAD script for the Rivendell Radio Automation
System that allows Rivendell to send articulated PAD to GlassCoder
instance. Use of this requires Python 3.4 or later, as well as the
Python 'Requests' module.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
The GlassCoder man pages are written in XML-DocBook5.  Pre-generated troff
versions are included in the source tarball, so special tools will not
normally be required to install them.  However, if you need to rebuild them
(either because you've modified the DocBook sources or are installing from
the primary GitHub repository), then you will need the following:

XML-DocBook5 Stylesheets.  Available at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/.  You will also need to create a
$DOCBOOK_STYLESHEETS variable in you environment that points to the top
of the stylesheet tree.  More information can be found at
http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/appa.html#s.stylesheetinstall.

xsltproc.  Command line XSLT processor.  Available at
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html

INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are set up, building and installation of the code is
done by cd'ing to the top of the source tree and typing './configure
[options]', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'.  Those who
obtained the source via CVS will need to do './autogen.sh' first.  There
are a number of options for the 'configure' script; do './configure --help'
for a detailed list.

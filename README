This is the README file for the GlassCoder package.

GlassCoder is a minimalist audio encoder for IceCast and Shoutcast streaming
servers that uses the JACK Audio Connection Kit.  GlassCoder utilizes no
configuration files or GUI interface at all; with a 'user interface' that
consists entirely of the command-line invocation.  As such, it is well
suited for use cases where the encoder is completely driven by an external
system or script.

At present, the following audio codecs are supported:

   MPEG Layer 3 ('MP3')

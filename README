This is the README file for the GlassCoder package.

See the file 'INSTALL' for instructions on building GlassCoder from source.

GlassCoder is a minimalist audio encoder for IceCast and Shoutcast streaming
servers as well as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). It supports the following
audio sources:

  Advanced Linux Sound Architeture (ALSA)
  AudioScience HPI (ASIHPI)
  File Streaming (FILE)
  JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK)

The base GlassCoder streamer component utilizes no configuration files or
GUI interface whatsoever; with the 'user interface' consisting entirely of
the command-line invocation.  As such, it is well suited for use cases where
the encoder is completely driven by an external system or script.

The following audio codecs are supported:

   MPEG-1/1.5 Layer 2 ('MP2')
   MPEG-1/1.5 Layer 3 ('MP3')
   MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding, High Efficiency Profile ('HE-AAC+')
   Ogg Opus
   Ogg Vorbis

Also included is GlassGui, a graphical point-and-click interface that can
be used to drive GlassCoder or generate command-line invocations that
can be copy/pasted to other systems.  A complete man page detailing the
options for glasscoder(1) is also provided.

This is the README file for the GlassCoder package.

GlassCoder is a minimalist audio encoder for IceCast and Shoutcast streaming
servers that uses the JACK Audio Connection Kit.  GlassCoder utilizes no
configuration files or GUI interface at all; the 'user interface' consists
entirely of the command-line invocation.  As such, it is well suited for
use cases where the encoder is completely driven by an external system or
script.

The following audio codecs are supported:

   MPEG-1/1.5 Layer 2 ('MP2')
   MPEG-1/1.5 Layer 3 ('MP3')
   MPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coding, Main Profile ('AAC')
   MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding, High Efficiency Profile ('HE-AAC+')
   Ogg Vorbis

This is the README file for the GlassCoder package.

This software comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  See the file 'COPYING' for
details.

See the file 'INSTALL' for instructions on building GlassCoder from source.

GlassCoder is a minimalist audio encoder for IceCast and Shoutcast streaming
servers as well as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). It supports the following
audio sources:

  Advanced Linux Sound Architeture (ALSA)
  AudioScience HPI (ASIHPI)
  File Streaming (FILE)
  JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK)

The base GlassCoder streamer component utilizes no configuration files or
GUI interface whatsoever; with the 'user interface' consisting entirely of
the command-line invocation.  As such, it is well suited for use cases where
the encoder is completely driven by an external system or script.

The following audio codecs are supported:

   MPEG-1/1.5 Layer 2 ('MP2')
   MPEG-1/1.5 Layer 3 ('MP3')
   MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding, High Efficiency Profile ('HE-AAC+')
   Ogg Opus
   Ogg Vorbis

The following additional utilities are included:

GlassGui, a GUI front end for a single instance of the glasscoder(1) audio
encoder. It provides a convenient and discoverable means for creating and
saving glasscoder(1) invocations as well as an instance management system
for saving multiple sets of configurations on the local system.

GlassCommander, a high-density GUI front end for the glasscoder(1) audio
encoder. It provides a convenient and discoverable means for creating and
saving glasscoder(1) invocations and an instance management system (fully
compatible with that of glassgui(1)) for saving multiple sets of
configurations on the local system in a manner that conserves screen
real-estate. Glasscommander(1) is capable of hosting dozens of simultaneous
glasscoder(1) instances while still allowing easy access to the control and
status of each one.

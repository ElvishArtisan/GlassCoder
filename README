This is the README file for the GlassCoder package.

GlassCoder is a minimalist audio encoder for IceCast and Shoutcast streaming
servers that uses the JACK Audio Connection Kit.  GlassCoder utilizes no
configuration files or GUI interface at all; its entire 'user interface'
consists of a command-line invocation.
